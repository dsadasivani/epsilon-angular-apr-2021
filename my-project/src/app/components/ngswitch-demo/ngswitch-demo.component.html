    <h3>Tiger</h3>
    <p>
      The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, most recognizable
      for its pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a
      lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with
      the lion, jaguar, leopard, and snow leopard. It is an apex predator,
      primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. It is territorial
      and generally a solitary but social predator, often requiring large
      contiguous areas of habitat that support its prey requirements. This,
      coupled with the fact that it is indigenous to some of the more densely
      populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.

    <h3>Lion</h3>
    <p>
      The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae; it is a
      muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and
      round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. The lion is sexually
      dimorphic; males are larger than females with a typical weight range of
      150 to 250 kg (330 to 550 lb) for males and 120 to 182 kg (265 to 400 lb)
      for females. Male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most
      recognisable feature of the species. A lion pride consists of a few adult
      males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions typically hunt
      together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The species is an apex and
      keystone predator, although they scavenge when opportunities occur. Some
      lions have been known to hunt humans, although the species typically does
      not.

    <h3>Cheetah</h3>
    <p>
      The cheetah (/ˈtʃiːtə/; Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat of the subfamily
      Felinae that occurs in Southern, North and East Africa, and a few
      localities in Iran. The species is IUCN Red Listed as vulnerable, as it
      suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century
      due to habitat loss, poaching, illegal pet trade, and conflict with
      humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at
      approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries
      have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.[1]

    <h3>Eagle</h3>
    <p>
      Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family
      Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several groups of genera, not all of which
      are closely related. Most of the 60 species of eagle are from Eurasia and
      Africa.[1] Outside this area, just 14 species can be found—2 in North
      America, 9 in Central and South America, and 3 in Australia.
